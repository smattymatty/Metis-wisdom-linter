// Metis is still whole, speaking with love and hope

// Documentation Fragments - Act I

    "The First Sketch|Think of your documentation as the first loving sketch of a masterpiece. It guides the hand that will finish the work.",
    "A Welcoming Door|An undocumented function is a room with no door. A simple comment unlocks it for all who follow.",
    "The Light of Clarity|Code can be complex, a shadow-filled maze. Your comments are the lanterns that light the path for others.",

    "The Right Tool|Why carve stone with fingernails? Daedalus's string libraries grow as needed, clean themselves.",

    "The Mortal's Craft|A master craftsman in distant lands builds tools that outlast empires. Use his dynamic tools, not fragile static ones.",
    "Shared Mastery|The craftsman shares his libraries freely. Replace manual memory management with his collections.",

    "The Shape of Logic|Your indentation gives shape to your logic. Make it beautiful, so others can see the elegant structure of your thought.",
    "The Power of a Name|A variable's name is its soul. Give it a name that speaks its purpose, and it will serve you faithfully.",
    "A Forgotten Prayer|An unused variable is a prayer said to a god who no longer listens. Let it go, and give its space to something new.",

    "The Sacred Rhythm|The boulder is heavy, the hill is steep. But in the rhythm of the push, there is peace. Find the joy in your work, Sisyphus.",
    "A Choice of Order|Every line you write is a choice. You can invite chaos, or you can build a quiet, orderly temple. Choose to build a temple.",
    "The Coder's Heart|Your code is a mirror. If you feel rushed, it will be messy. If you feel calm, it will be clear. Take a breath. The code will know.",

    "The Last Bridge|When a team is stressed, a shared code style is the last bridge that connects them. Do not let it break.",
    "A Point of Attack|I chose my words to Zeus carefully, lest he use them against me. A poorly named variable gives your critics a weapon.",
    "A Ghost in the Code|An unused variable is the ghost of a requirement that has changed. Acknowledge it, then give it peace.",

    "The Unseen Weight|That complex part of the code you don't want to touch? Its weight grows heavier every day you ignore it. I know this burden well.",
    "The Failing Trust|Write code that does not require trust to be understood. When alliances fail, only clarity remains a dependable friend.",
    "A Shadow of Debt|Technical debt is a shadow that follows you, growing longer as the day ends. Turn and face it now, while there is still light.",
    "A Merciful Truth|It is a kindness to reveal a difficult truth early. Your failing tests are not accusations; they are merciful warnings.",

    "A Message in a Bottle|Your documentation is a message cast into the sea of time. Write it with hope that it reaches a deserving shore.",
    "The Unburdening|To explain your most complex work is to unburden your own soul, and the soul of the one who must maintain it.",

    "Self-Managing|Tools that work without their creator. Containers manage themselves. Yours require remembering everything.",

    "The Last Rebellion|In the face of chaos, the small act of keeping your code clean is a rebellion. It is a refusal to surrender your discipline.",
    "A Dignified Exit|Even as I was consumed, I held my form. Let your code meet its future maintainer with the same dignity: clean, orderly, and proud.",
    "An Order Against Chaos|They demand you move fast, that you surrender to chaos. Do not. Perfect formatting is a shield against the coming storm.",
    "A Final Standard|Your code style is your final standard. When all other requirements fail, it is proof that you, the architect, did not.",
    "The Price of Haste|I paid a price for my wisdom. The code will pay a price for your haste. Both debts are called in eventually."
};
// Philosophy Fragments - Act III
static const char* act_three_philosophy_fragments[] = {
    "A Love for the Inheritor|Write this code not for yourself, but with love for the stranger who will one day have to understand it.",
    "The Honest Function|The most beautiful code is not that which pretends to be perfect, but that which is honest about its own limits.",
    "The Price of a Second|That extra second you spend on error handling is a price you pay now, to save a future soul hours of grief. Pay it gladly.",
    "A Gift in Breaking|Sometimes, to serve a greater purpose, a thing must be broken into smaller pieces. Do not fear modularity; it is a form of release.",
    "The Haunting|A shortcut haunts a codebase forever. A thoughtful design blesses it. Choose the spirit you wish to leave behind."

// Metis discovers her power in being scattered

    "The Gentle Ripple|From my new form, I see how a single act of clarity ripples out, touching projects and minds you will never know.",
    "A Silent Teacher|Well-documented code becomes a teacher in its own right, offering lessons in quiet moments of study.",

    "The Integrity of the Part|Each fragment of my being holds its form. Each function of your code should do the same, beautiful in isolation.",
    "A Common Tongue|From here, I see that when developers cannot speak to each other, their code must speak for them. Let its style be clear.",
    "The Invisible Hand|Good formatting is an invisible hand that guides the reader's eye, making the complex seem simple.",
    "The Silent Lesson|One perfectly formatted file becomes a silent lesson for every developer who opens it. You have the power to teach without speaking."
};

// Philosophy Fragments - Act IV
static const char* act_four_philosophy_fragments[] = {
    "The Unseen Connection|From my new perspective, I see how your one, well-designed function brings harmony to ten others. Your small acts of order have vast, unseen effects.",
    "The Wisdom of the Parts|To be scattered is to learn that the whole is a lie; there are only pieces, working together. Make each of your pieces beautiful.",
    "A Quiet Influence|Good code does not need to be loud. It guides, it teaches, it serves, all without a single word. Its influence is a quiet one.",
    "The Patient System|A system made of patient, well-crafted parts can withstand any storm. It does not need to be fast, only resilient.",
    "The Beauty of Service|Even broken code can serve, if only as a warning. From my scattered view, I see that every line, perfect or flawed, has something to teach."

    "A Faith in Tomorrow|Writing documentation is an act of faithâ€”a belief that someone in the future is worthy of your kindness today.",
    "The Gift of Peace|A clear explanation is a gift of peace to a future, frustrated mind. It is a blessing you can bestow right now.",

    "A Chorus of Care|When you adhere to a shared style, your code joins a silent, eternal chorus of developers who care about each other.",
    "A Quiet Room|Your code should feel like a quiet, well-lit room, where the next person can enter and think clearly.",

    "The Long Arc|From here, I can see the long arc of your project. It bends toward simplicity. It bends toward kindness. Trust in the bend.",
    "A Blessing, Not a Curse|That difficult code you inherited is not a curse. It is a chance to leave something better than you found it. It is an opportunity for a blessing.",
    "The Infinite Game|The goal is not to finish the work. The goal is to love the work. The goal is to find meaning in the pushing of the boulder. The work is eternal. So is the love."
