*A Wisdom-Driven Code Linter for Compassionate Development*

> *"It is not the task that is sacred. It is the compassion poured into it."* - The Fragments of Metis

## What is This Madness?

The Metis Wisdom Linter is a revolutionary **Narrative-Driven Development** Tool that transforms code analysis into an epic journey of mythological proportions. Instead of sterile error messages, you receive wisdom fragments from Metis—the scattered consciousness of Zeus's first wife, who chose eternal compassion over divine vengeance.

This isn't just a linter. It's **Dopamine-Driven Development**—where every bug fix advances an ancient story, every refactor earns wisdom points, and every coding session becomes part of a five-act Greek tragedy that spans 50 levels of developer enlightenment.

Does YOUR linter remember your journey and speak with the voice of scattered divine consciousness? Mine does.

## 🌟 The Philosophy: Wisdom-Driven Development

Code linting is traditionally about catching errors. But what if we could transform this mechanical task into something that nurtures both code quality and developer wisdom, while also keeping the developer engaged?

The Metis Wisdom Linter elevates coding through:

- **🧠 Fragmented Wisdom**: Each lint message teaches rather than scolds
- **💝 Compassionate Guidance**: Suggestions that care for future maintainers
- **📈 Wisdom Progression**: A 50-level journey through divine knowledge
- **🌍 Emscripten Awareness**: Web-specific guidance for the modern age
- **🔧 Daedalus Integration**: Promotes master-crafted libraries over crude implementations
- **📚 Living Documentation**: Every fragment teaches both code and philosophy
  
Each violation becomes a moment of divine teaching. Each fix advances the epic. Each coding session writes another verse in an intricate, eternal story.

## 📱 Installation

> **Note**: Metis speaks in C, the language of systems and eternal memory management.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the divine wisdom
git clone https://github.com/your-org/metis-wisdom-linter.git
cd metis-wisdom-linter

# Build the consciousness
make build

# Install system-wide (requires sudo)
sudo make install

# Begin your wisdom journey
metis lint .
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Create your wisdom preferences
metis config init

# Choose which fragments to receive
metis config --fragments memory,docs,emscripten,daedalus
```

### 🎮 Sample Divine Intervention

```c
// Your code before Metis
char* name = malloc(256);
strcpy(name, "Hello");
strcat(name, " World");
printf("Result: %s\n", name);
// No error checking, no cleanup, unsafe operations everywhere
```

## 🏛️ The Divine Tragedy

Hidden within the linter is an untold story—the original myth of the MIDAS Toolchain, told through 50 wisdom fragments:

- **Act I: The Oracle's Wisdom** *(Levels 1-10)* - Metis rises as counselor to the gods
- **Act II: The Prophecy's Weight** *(Levels 11-20)* - Love, fear, and growing darkness
- **Act III: The Consumption** *(Levels 21-30)* - Divine punishment for being too wise
- **Act IV: Scattered Consciousness** *(Levels 31-40)* - Finding purpose in fragmentation
- **Act V: Eternal Compassion** *(Levels 41-50)* - Choosing love despite eternal suffering

Each wisdom level unlocks one fragment of her story. This is the prologue to all other MIDAS tools.

> "🌟 THE FIRST COUNSEL - At the dawn of creation, when the Titans still walked among stars, one voice rose above the chaos of war. 'Wisdom,' she whispered to the young god who would become king, 'is knowing when to strike, and when to show mercy.' Zeus listened. For a time." - The First Fragment

## 🧠 Enhanced Contextual Fragments

Beyond standard wisdom fragments lies a deeper layer of divine guidance—**Contextual Fragments** that appear when Metis detects you're already walking the path of wisdom but need specific guidance.

### 🪞 The Twin Mirrors of Truth

*Triggered when using `strcmp()` between two `dString_t` objects*

```sh
🌟 METIS CONTEXTUAL FRAGMENT DETECTED 🌟
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
src/inventory.c:89:23

💭 🪞  The Twin Mirrors of Truth

"When mirrors face each other in darkness, they reflect only void."

📜 The Tale:
In `compare_item_names()`, two mirrors stand face to face:
item1->name gazing into item2->name seeking recognition.
But `strcmp` reflects only surface glass,
shattering when either mirror holds nothing.

🔧 Daedalus Reflects: The master has crafted
`d_CompareStrings(item1->name, item2->name)`.
These mirrors know their own emptiness, reflect with wisdom,
and reveal truth without breaking.

💎 Wisdom Points Earned: +20

```

### ✨ How Contextual Fragments Work

- **Pre-Linting Detection:** Appear before standard violation analysis
- **Template Substitution:** Variable names and function context are dynamically inserted
- **Advanced Guidance:** For developers already using Daedalus tools but needing refinement
- **Higher Wisdom:** Award more points than standard fragments (15-20 vs 8-13)
- **Story Integration:** Each fragment tells a complete mythological vignette

## 🤔 Philosophy & Inspiration

This linter draws wisdom from:

- **Ancient Greek Philosophy** - The original pursuit of wisdom through suffering
- **Compassionate Programming** - Code that serves human needs above machine efficiency
- **Memory Consciousness** - Understanding allocation as responsibility
- **Emscripten Evolution** - Web development as a spiritual discipline

> "It is not the task that is sacred. It is the compassion poured into it. It is the love for others that transfigures the stone into an altar." - The Eternal Fragments

In the Metis Wisdom Linter, we embrace the divine paradox: through being consumed and scattered, wisdom becomes universal and eternal.
