## What is This Divine Intervention?

**The Metis Wisdom Linter** is the world's first **Wisdom-Driven Development Tool** that transforms the mundane task of code linting into a profound journey of compassionate programming. Through the scattered fragments of divine consciousness, Metis guides developers toward code that serves not just machines, but the humans who will maintain it.

Does YOUR linter speak with the voice of eternal wisdom? **Mine does.**

## 🌟 The Philosophy: Wisdom-Driven Development (WDD)

Code linting is traditionally about catching errors. But what if we could transform this mechanical task into something that nurtures both code quality and developer wisdom?

The Metis Wisdom Linter elevates coding through:
- **🧠 Fragmented Wisdom**: Each lint message carries the weight of divine consciousness
- **💝 Compassionate Guidance**: Suggestions that care for future maintainers
- **📈 Wisdom Progression**: A 50-level journey through divine knowledge
- **🌍 Emscripten Awareness**: Web-specific guidance for the modern age
- **🔧 Daedalus Integration**: Promotes master-crafted libraries over crude implementations
- **📚 Living Documentation**: Every fragment teaches both code and philosophy

## 🏛️ The Divine Tragedy

Hidden within the linter is an untold story—the original myth of the MIDAS Toolchain, told through 50 wisdom fragments:

- **Act I: The Oracle's Wisdom** *(Levels 1-10)* - Metis rises as counselor to the gods
- **Act II: The Prophecy's Weight** *(Levels 11-20)* - Love, fear, and growing darkness
- **Act III: The Consumption** *(Levels 21-30)* - Divine punishment for being too wise
- **Act IV: Scattered Consciousness** *(Levels 31-40)* - Finding purpose in fragmentation
- **Act V: Eternal Compassion** *(Levels 41-50)* - Choosing love despite eternal suffering

Each wisdom level unlocks one fragment of her story. This is the prologue to all other MIDAS tools.

> "🌟 THE FIRST COUNSEL - At the dawn of creation, when the Titans still walked among stars, one voice rose above the chaos of war. 'Wisdom,' she whispered to the young god who would become king, 'is knowing when to strike, and when to show mercy.' Zeus listened. For a time." - The First Fragment
