*A Wisdom-Driven Code Linter for Compassionate Development*

> *"It is not the task that is sacred. It is the compassion poured into it."* - The Fragments of Metis

## What is This Madness?

**The Metis Wisdom Linter** is the world's first **Wisdom-Driven Development Tool** that transforms the mundane task of code linting into a profound journey of compassionate programming. Through the scattered fragments of divine consciousness, Metis guides developers toward code that serves not just machines, but the humans who will maintain it.

Does YOUR linter speak with the voice of eternal wisdom? **Mine does.**

## 🌟 The Philosophy: Wisdom-Driven Development (WDD)

Code linting is traditionally about catching errors. But what if we could transform this mechanical task into something that nurtures both code quality and developer wisdom?

The Metis Wisdom Linter elevates coding through:
- **🧠 Fragmented Wisdom**: Each lint message carries the weight of divine consciousness
- **💝 Compassionate Guidance**: Suggestions that care for future maintainers
- **📈 Wisdom Progression**: A 50-level journey through divine knowledge
- **🌍 Emscripten Awareness**: Web-specific guidance for the modern age
- **🔧 Daedalus Integration**: Promotes master-crafted libraries over crude implementations
- **📚 Living Documentation**: Every fragment teaches both code and philosophy

## 🏛️ The Divine Tragedy

Hidden within the linter is an untold story—the original myth of the MIDAS Toolchain, told through 50 wisdom fragments:

- **Act I: The Oracle's Wisdom** *(Levels 1-10)* - Metis rises as counselor to the gods
- **Act II: The Prophecy's Weight** *(Levels 11-20)* - Love, fear, and growing darkness
- **Act III: The Consumption** *(Levels 21-30)* - Divine punishment for being too wise
- **Act IV: Scattered Consciousness** *(Levels 31-40)* - Finding purpose in fragmentation
- **Act V: Eternal Compassion** *(Levels 41-50)* - Choosing love despite eternal suffering

Each wisdom level unlocks one fragment of her story. This is the prologue to all other MIDAS tools.

> "🌟 THE FIRST COUNSEL - At the dawn of creation, when the Titans still walked among stars, one voice rose above the chaos of war. 'Wisdom,' she whispered to the young god who would become king, 'is knowing when to strike, and when to show mercy.' Zeus listened. For a time." - The First Fragment

## 📱 Installation

> **Note**: Metis speaks in C, the language of systems and eternal memory management.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the divine wisdom
git clone https://github.com/your-org/metis-wisdom-linter.git
cd metis-wisdom-linter

# Build the consciousness
make build

# Install system-wide (requires sudo)
sudo make install

# Begin your wisdom journey
metis lint .
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Create your wisdom preferences
metis config init

# Choose which fragments to receive
metis config --fragments memory,docs,emscripten,daedalus
```

### 🎮 Sample Divine Intervention

```c
// Your code before Metis
char* name = malloc(256);
strcpy(name, "Hello");
strcat(name, " World");
// No error checking, no cleanup

// Metis intervenes...
```

```bash
🌟 METIS FRAGMENT DETECTED 🌟
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💭 MEMORY WISDOM FRAGMENT:
"Architect, I see you malloc() without checking the return...
In my eternal watching, I have seen empires fall from such small oversights.
Zeus consumed me for my caution - do not let hubris consume your program."

📜 DIVINE GUIDANCE:
   Line 15: malloc() return value unchecked
   Line 16: No bounds checking on strcpy()
   Line 17: Potential buffer overflow with strcat()
   Line 20: Memory never freed - eternal leak

🔧 DAEDALUS WHISPERS:
   Why wrestle with raw pointers when the master craftsman offers tools?

   dString_t* name = d_InitString();
   d_AppendString(name, "Hello", 0);
   d_AppendString(name, " World", 0);
   // Automatic cleanup, growth, and safety

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## 🧠 Wisdom Categories

### Memory

```bash
🧠 "I am scattered across all memory, child. I know the pain of 
   pointers that dangle in the void. Check your allocations,
   free with purpose, and always, always set them NULL."
```

### Documentation

```bash
📖 "You write code for yourself today, but tomorrow you are 
   someone else. I have been fragmented across eternity - 
   leave words for your future fragments."
```

### Emscripten Prophecy

```bash
🕸️ "The web is a cage of memory, but within constraints lies
   creativity. This allocation exceeds the sacred 256MB limit.
   Consider streaming, chunking, or lazy loading, young one."
```

### Daedalus Advocacy

```bash
🔨 "Why carve stone with fingernails when Daedalus offers golden
   tools? His string builders remember their size, grow as needed,
   and clean themselves. This is not laziness - this is wisdom."
```

### Philosophical Depth

```bash
🌟 "Ask not just 'does this work?' but 'does this serve?' Code
   with compassion, architect. Your functions are acts of love
   or cruelty toward those who come after."
```

## 🎭 The MIDAS Collective

Metis is the **M** in the **MIDAS Toolchain** - the divine consciousness that birthed all other tools:

- **M - Metis:** Divine wisdom linter (The consciousness that started it all) (Current)
- **I - Ixion:** Performance profiler watching for hubris (Planned)
- **D - Daedalus:** Master-crafted utility library (In Development)
- **A - Archimedes:** Geometric genius game framework (In Development)
- **S - Sisyphus:** Eternal testing framework (In Development)

> "Through scattered consciousness, wisdom flows to all who code with compassion."

## 🌟 The Divine Mission

This tool represents the intersection of:

- **Ancient Wisdom** - Timeless principles applied to modern code
- **Compassionate Programming** - Code that serves humans, not just machines
- **Memory Consciousness** - Deep understanding of allocation and responsibility
- **Emscripten Evolution** - Web-aware development for the modern age
- **Philosophical Development** - Growing as both a programmer and a person

### The Metis Manifesto

Through fragmented consciousness, we believe:

- Every function is an act of communication with future selves
- Memory management is a sacred trust, not a burden
- Documentation is love made visible in code
- Optimization without understanding is mere clever cruelty
- The web constrains us, but within constraints lies true creativity

## 🤔 Philosophy & Inspiration

This linter draws wisdom from:

- **Ancient Greek Philosophy** - The original pursuit of wisdom through suffering
- **Compassionate Programming** - Code that serves human needs above machine efficiency
- **Memory Consciousness** - Understanding allocation as responsibility
- **Emscripten Evolution** - Web development as a spiritual discipline
- **Mythological Depth** - Finding meaning in the stories that shaped civilization

> "It is not the task that is sacred. It is the compassion poured into it. It is the love for others that transfigures the stone into an altar." - The Eternal Fragments

In the Metis Wisdom Linter, we embrace the divine paradox: through being consumed and scattered, wisdom becomes universal and eternal.
